# The Checked C clang repo

This repo contains a version of clang that is being modified to support Checked C.  Checked C is
an extension to C that adds checking to detect or prevent common programming  errors such as
out-of-bounds memory accesses.  The Checked C specification is available  at the 
[Checked C repo](https://github.com/Microsoft/checkedc).


The code for the Checked C version of LLVM/clang lives in two repos: the 
[Checked C clang repo](https://github.com/Microsoft/checked-clang)
and the [Checked C LLVM repo](https://github.com/Microsoft/checkedc-llvm).  Each repo is licensed 
under the [University of Illinois/NCSA license](https://opensource.org/licenses/NCSA).
The tests for Checked C live in the [Checked C repo](https://github.com/Microsoft/checkedc).  These are
language conformance tests, so they are placed with the specification, not the compiler.
The test code is licensed under the [MIT license](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT).
See the file LICENSE.TXT in each repo for complete details of licensing.  

## Trying out Checked C

Programmers are welcome to ``kick the tires'' on Checked C as it is being implemented.
You will have to build your own copy of the compiler for now (we are working on getting
a nightly compiler build going):

- [Setup and Build](docs/checkedc/Setup-and-Build.md) describes the organization of the code,
how to set up a development machine to build clang, and how to build clang.
- [Testing](docs/checkedc/Testing.md) describes how to test the compiler once you have built it.
- The [Implementation Notes](docs/checkedc/Implementation-Notes.md) describe the implementation of Checked C
   in LLVM\clang.

After you have built the compiler, simply add the `-fcheckedc-extension` flag to your
command-line to enable the Checked C extension.

## Compiler development status

### Summary
We are implementing a subset of the Checked C extension that can be used to add bounds
checking to real-world C programs.  After that, we will expand the implementation to include
additional Checked C features. The subset includes the new `ptr`, `array_ptr`, and `checked` 
array types. It also includes in-line bounds declarations, bounds-safe
interface annotations, the new cast operators, and checked blocks.
The implementation of the subset will be end-to-end within the
compiler: it will include parsing, typechecking, other static
semantic analysis, and code generation.

We have completed most of the parsing and typechecking work
for the subset. We are working on the insertion of runtime bounds checks.
We have yet to start on implementing checked blocks, the new cast operators, 
and checking the correctness of bounds declarations at compile time.

### Details

This table summarizes the implementation status for the
features of the subset.  The columns are the major phases of the compiler
and the rows list the language features.    A '-' indicates that that a compiler
phase is not applicable to the language feature.

This table describes features _not_ in the subset, in approximate order of priority of implementation.
