# The Checked C clang repo

This repo contains a version of clang that is being modified to support Checked C.  Checked C 
extends C with checking to detect or prevent common programming  errors such as
out-of-bounds memory accesses.  The Checked C specification is available  at the 
[Checked C repo](https://github.com/Microsoft/checkedc).

## News

We updated the LLVM/clang sources that we are using on June 20th, 2017.  If you have built your own copy
of the compiler, you will need to delete your cmake build directory and re-run cmake after you sync.

## Trying out Checked C

Programmers are welcome to ``kick the tires'' on Checked C as it is being implemented.
You will have to build your own copy of the compiler for now.  The compiler code and tests
are in multiple repos.

- [Setup and Build](docs/checkedc/Setup-and-Build.md) describes the organization of the code
and tests, how to set up a development machine to build clang, and how to build clang.
- [Testing](docs/checkedc/Testing.md) describes how to test the compiler once you have built it.
- The [Implementation Notes](docs/checkedc/Implementation-Notes.md) describe the implementation of Checked C
   in LLVM\clang.

## Compiler development status

We are implementing a subset of the Checked C extension that can be used to add bounds
checking to real-world C programs.   The implementation roadmap and status are on the
[Checked C Wiki](https://github.com/Microsoft/checkedc-clang/wiki/Implementation-roadmap-and-status).
