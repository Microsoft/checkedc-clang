# The Checked C clang repo

This repo contains a version of clang that is being modified to support Checked C.  Checked C 
extends C with checking to detect or prevent common programming  errors such as
out-of-bounds memory accesses.  The Checked C specification is available  at the 
[Checked C repo](https://github.com/Microsoft/checkedc).

## Announcement

Earlier this year, the LLVM community
[transitioned](https://forums.swift.org/t/llvm-monorepo-transition/25689) to
"monorepo". To align with upstream, we are now planning to transition Checked C
to a monorepo.

Starting the first week of Oct 2019, the checkedc-clang project will transition to
monorepo. This would result in the following changes:

1. [checkedc-llvm](https://github.com/Microsoft/checkedc-llvm) and
[checkedc-clang](https://github.com/Microsoft/checkedc-clang) (as well as other
LLVM subprojects) would be tracked via a single git repo.

2. The [checkedc-llvm](https://github.com/Microsoft/checkedc-llvm) repo would
no longer be maintained. The
[checkedc-clang](https://github.com/Microsoft/checkedc-clang) repo would be the
new monorepo.

3. There would be no changes to the
[checkedc](https://github.com/Microsoft/checkedc) repo. It would continue to be
a separate git repo.

4. All future patches should be based off this new monorepo.

5. You can use
[this](https://github.com/microsoft/checkedc-clang/blob/monorepo/clang/automation/UNIX/cherry-pick-to-monorepo.sh)
script to cherry-pick your existing patches to the new monorepo.

6. Make sure to set the following CMake flag to enable clang in your builds:
  `-DLLVM_ENABLE_PROJECTS=clang`

## Compiler source code update

On January 25, 2019, we updated to LLVM/clang sources from January 16, 2019.  If you are building the Checked C clang compiler 
from source code, we suggest you do a clean build by deleting your cmake object directory.

## We are hiring.

We have a position available for a 
[Principal Software Engineer](https://careers.microsoft.com/us/en/job/559081/Principal-Software-Engineer) or a
[Senior Software Engineer](https://careers.microsoft.com/us/en/job/570339/Senior-Software-Engineer). We are looking for someone wih compiler and programming language implementation experience who is passionate about making software more secure and reliable.

## Trying out Checked C

Programmers are welcome to ``kick the tires'' on Checked C as it is being implemented.
We have pre-built compiler installers for Windows available for download on the
[release page](https://github.com/Microsoft/checkedc-clang/releases).
For other platforms, you will have to build your own copy of the compiler.  For directions on how to do this, see
the [Checked C clang wiki](https://github.com/Microsoft/checkedc-clang/wiki).   The compiler user manual is [here](https://github.com/Microsoft/checkedc-clang/wiki/Checked-C-clang-user-manual).
For more information on Checked C and pointers to example code, see our [Wiki](https://github.com/Microsoft/checkedc/wiki).
