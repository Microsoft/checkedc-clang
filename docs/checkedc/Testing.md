# Testing the Checked C version of LLVM/clang

We have created a new LLVM test suite for the Checked C extension.  We have added a new
target to the build system for running the test suite: check-checkedc. 

The Checked C version of clang/LLVM should pass the same tests as the baseline version
of clang/LLVM (in the baseline branch) and the Checked C specific tests.   The testing
results for the baseline branch are recorded in [testing baselines](Test-Baselines.md).
A developer should confirm that no new unexpected failures occur as a result of a change
before committing a change.

When testing a change, the testing should be sufficient for the type of change.  For changes
to parsing and typechecking, it is usually sufficient to pass the Checked C and clang tests.

## Running tests

### From Visual Studio
Load the solution and the open it using the Solution explorer (View->Solution Explorer).  To run tests, you can right click and build the following targets:

- Checked C tests: go to _CheckedC tests->check-checkedc_
- clang tests: go to _Clang tests->check-clang_
- All LLVM and clang tests: select the check-all solution (at the top level)

### From a command shell using msbuild
Set up the build system and then change to your new object directory.  Use the following commands to run tests:

- Checked C tests: `msbuild projects\checkedc-llvm\check-checkedc.vcxproj /maxcpucount:`_number of processors_/3
- Clang tests: `msbuild tools\clang\test\check-clang.vcxproj /maxcpucount:1number of processors/3
- All LLVM and clang tests: `msbuild check-all.vcxproj /maxcpucount:`number of processors/3`

### Using make
In your build directory,

- Checked C tests: `make check-checkedc`
- clang tests: `make check-clang`
- All tests: `make check-all`

### From a command shell using the testing harness
You can use the testing harness to run individual tests or sets of tests.
These directions are adapted from http://llvm.org/docs/TestingGuide.html#id11.
The clang-specific documentation on running tests appears to be out-of-date, so don't try to follow those directions.  

- The build creates a llvm-lit.py script that you can use to run regression tests by hand.
  It is placed in the same directory as your newly built clang executable.   Those are placed in {your build directory}\debug\bin. 
- Set the environment variable CLANG to the full path of your clang executable.  For example:

		set CLANG=d:\autobahn1\llvm.obj\Debug\bin\clang.exe

- You can point the llvm-lit script at a directory to run all tests or an individual test.  For example:

		llvm-lit d:\autobahn1\llvm\tools\clang\test

## Test baselines
We have observed a few tests fail unexpectedly on Windows on a clean LLVM/clang
enlistment.  These tests don't seem to fail on the buildbots. We have not 
tracked down the source of the failures.  For now, we are using
[testing baselines](Test-Baselines.md) to exclude these tests.  LLVM/clang has
an optimistic check-in policy, so it is possible that a few tests may fail in
the main-line repos when we update to the latest sources.
