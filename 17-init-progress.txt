[COMPILES} clang/lib/CodeGen/CGDynamicCheck.cpp [TODO: review whether we need to use CreateElementBitCast]
[TODO] Various 3C files

TODO:
1. Replace makeArrayRef with use of ArrayRef constructor (I think).  makeArrayRef has been deprecated and we get a warning about it.
2. Review whether whether merge changes in  clang/lib/CodeGen/CGDynamicCheck.cpp need to use CreateElementBitCast instead
   of CreateBitCast.

See:
commit f208644ed3618fb1db195adbd35ae0acf2819f23
Author: Nikita Popov <npopov@redhat.com>
Date:   Mon Feb 14 14:18:04 2022 +0100

    [CGBuilder] Remove CreateBitCast() method

    Use CreateElementBitCast() instead, or don't work on Address
    where not necessary.
