This directory contains clang-implementation specific tests for Checked C.
It does not contain language conformance tests for the Checked C extension.
Those are stored separately in the Checked C project repository.  Those tests
are available under llvm\projects\checkedc-wrapper\checkedc\tests.  You 
will need to place the Checked C repo at the checkedc subdirectory.
